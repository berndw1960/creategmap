Description:

mapset.py -     if you want to build more then one mapset, as example dach and
                germany.

                mapset.py -h shows a help

pygmap3.py -    the main script, start it without any option to create map
                for DACH with the default style of mkgmap

                you need a poly file of the region, if you want to build your
                choice of region
                search for osm2poly and poly2osm in the web, if you want to
                create a poly file from scratch.

                if you want to create your maps with your own styles,
                you have to do some work

                add a folder named {your_map}_style and a textbased file
                named {your_map}_typ.txt to the folder 'mystyles'

                you can also use our fork of the AIO, copy the complete
                repository to 'mystyles'

                pygmap3.py -h shows a help
                pygmap3.py -m basemap enable the build of our basemap style

planet_up.py -  download  a complete planet from openstreetmap.org or update it

keep_data.py -  needed, if you want to build a map with older mapdata
                keep_data.py is a FlipFlop to stop some functions in pygmap3.py
                start it with 'keep_data.py', there are no options needed

no_split.py -   like 'keep_data.py, but it do this only for the split-function
                in 'splitter.py'

all other *.py are helper for 'pygmap3.py', they must be in the same folder!
