www.openstreetmap.org

tested with
eTrex Vista Hcx
eTrex Legend
Oregon 450
some NÃ¼vis


Despription:

pygmap3.py - the main script, start it without any option to create a basemap
             for DACH
             pygmap3.py -h shows a help

planet_up.py - download  a complete planet from openstreetmap.org or update it

keep_data.py - needed, if you want to build a map with older mapdata
               keep_data.py is a FlipFlop to stop some functions in pygmap3.py
               start it with 'keep_data.py', there are no options needed

no_split.py - like 'keep_data.py, but it do this only for the split-function in
              'mkgmap.py'

all other *.py are helper for 'pygmap3.py'
