Usage: java [JAVA_OPTIONS] -jar splitter.jar [OPTIONS] input_file (*.osm or *.pbf or *.o5m)
Options:
 --boundary-tags   A comma separated list of tag values for relations. Used 
                   to filter multipolygon and boundary relations for 
                   problem-list processing. Default is use-exclude-list. 
 --cache           Deprecated, now does nothing 
 --description     A default description to give to each area. 
 --geonames-file   The name of a GeoNames file to use for determining tile 
                   names. Typically cities15000.zip from 
                   http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/ 
 --keep-complete   Write complete ways and relations if possible (requires 
                   more time and more heap memory). This should be used with 
                   --overlap=0 Default is true. 
 --mapid           The starting map ID. Default is 63240001. 
 --max-areas       The maximum number of areas to process in a single pass. 
                   More areas require more memory, but less time. Values: 
                   1-4096. Default is 512. 
 --max-nodes       A threshold value that is used when no split-file is 
                   given. Splitting is done so that no tile has more than 
                   maxNodes nodes inside the bounding box of the tile. Nodes 
                   added by overlap or keep-complete are not taken into 
                   account. Default is 1600000. 
 --max-threads     The maximum number of threads used by splitter. Default is 
                   auto. 
 --mixed           Specify this if the input osm file has nodes, ways and 
                   relations intermingled. 
 --no-trim         Don't trim empty space off the edges of tiles. 
 --output          The output type, either pbf, o5m, or xml. Default is pbf. 
 --output-dir      The path to the output directory. Defaults to the current 
                   working directory. 
 --overlap         Deprecated. Nodes/ways/rels that fall outside an area will 
                   still be included if they are within this many map units.  
                   Default is auto. 
 --polygon-file    The name of a file containing a bounding polygon in 
                   osmosis polygon file format. 
 --precomp-sea     The name of a directory containing precompiled sea tiles. 
 --problem-file    The name of a file containing ways and relations that are 
                   known to cause problems in the split process. 
 --problem-report  The name of a file to write the generated problem list 
                   created with --keep-complete. 
 --resolution      The resolution of the overview map to be produced by 
                   mkgmap. Default is 13. 
 --split-file      The name of a file containing the areas definitions. Can 
                   be .list or .kml. Providing such a file will save 
                   processing time. 
 --status-freq     Displays the amount of memory used by the JVM every 
                   --status-freq seconds. Set =0 to disable. Default is 120. 
 --stop-after      Debugging: stop after the program phase. Can be split, 
                   gen-problem-list, or handle-problem-list Default is dist. 
 --write-kml       The name of a kml file to write out the areas to. This is 
                   in addition to areas.list (which is always written out).
