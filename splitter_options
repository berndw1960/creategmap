Usage: java [JAVA_OPTIONS] -jar splitter.jar [OPTIONS] input_file (*.osm or *.pbf or *.o5m)
Options:
 --cache           Deprecated, now does nothing
 --description     A default description to give to each area.
 --geonames-file   The name of a GeoNames file to use for determining tile names. Typically cities15000.zip from http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/
 --keep-complete   Write complete ways and relations if possible (requires more time and more heap memory). This should be used with --overlap=0
 --mapid           The starting map ID. Default is 63240001.
 --max-areas       The maximum number of areas to process in a single pass. More areas require more memory, but less time. Values: 1-2048. Default is 255.
 --max-nodes       A threshold value that is used when no split-file is given. Splitting is done so that no tile has more than maxNodes nodes inside the bounding box of the tile. Nodes added by overlap or keep-complete are not taken into account. Default is 1600000.
 --max-threads     The maximum number of threads used by splitter. Default is auto.
 --mixed           Specify this if the input osm file has nodes, ways and relations intermingled.
 --no-trim         Don't trim empty space off the edges of tiles.
 --output          The output type, either pbf, o5m, or xml. Default is pbf.
 --output-dir      The path to the output directory. Defaults to the current working directory.
 --overlap         Nodes/ways/rels that fall outside an area will still be included if they are within this many map units. Default is -1.
 --polygon-file    The name of a file containing a bounding polygon in osmosis polygon file format.
 --problem-file    The name of a file containing ways and relations that are known to cause problems in the split process.
 --problem-report  The name of a file to write the generated problem list created with --keep-complete.
 --resolution      The resolution of the overview map to be produced by mkgmap. Default is 13.
 --split-file      The name of a file containing the areas definitions. Can be .list or .kml. Providing such a file will save processing time.
 --status-freq     Displays the amount of memory used by the JVM every --status-freq seconds. Set =0 to disable. Default is 120.
 --version         Just write program version and build timestamp
 --write-kml       The name of a kml file to write out the areas to. This is in addition to areas.list (which is always written out).
